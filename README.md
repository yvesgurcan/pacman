Pacman in the browser. Original code copied from https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman.

Used on https://www.twitch.tv/yvesgurcan as a waiting screen before the stream starts.

- **Added """AI""".** Basically, Pacman chooses random directions. He's pretty dumb. #makePacmanSmarter
- **Turned sound OFF.** Maybe the sound can be turned ON on user click instead of being completely OFF?
